(Steps to get your notebook up and running with your correct env/kernel)

">" = the conda shell prompt.

> where python  (to list where your python intepreter locations/envs)

(refer to 'conda-cheatsheet.pdf' in my downloads folder...)

> conda create --name <envname>

> conda activate <envname>

> conda list
> python --version
  (If no python or packages exist in this env,
   then do a "> conda install pip" do kick things off and
   then rerun the above two commands for better results!)

> conda env list

> conda list
  (assume you installed jupyter in your env already)

> conda install -c anaconda ipykernel 
 (or if you installed jupyter in your env already, it may have added ipykernel already)

> python -m ipykernel install --user --name=<envname>   (this step is required to have your env kernel ready for your notebook?)
  ( or ipython kernel install --user --name=<envname> )

> jupyter notebook

	1. Wait for jupyter to launch in browser window
    2. In jupyter browser window...
    3. Under "New", look for your env and select it
       (or under "Change Kernel", look for your env and select it)

> jupyter kernelspec list

> jupyter kernelspec remove <kernelname>
