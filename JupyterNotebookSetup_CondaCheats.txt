> python --version
  (If no python or packages exist in this env,
   then do a "> conda install pip" to kick things off and
   then rerun the above two commands for better results!)

> conda install -c anaconda ipykernel 
 (or if you installed jupyter in your env already, it may have added ipykernel already)

> conda list -e > requirements.txt (generate requirements.txt file)
> conda env export > <environment-name>.yml 
> conda env create -f <environment-name>.yml  (creating new env on another machine)

> python -m ipykernel install --user --name=<envname>   (this step is required to have your env kernel ready for your notebook?)
  ( or ipython kernel install --user --name=<envname> )

    1. Wait for jupyter to launch in browser window
    2. In jupyter browser window...
    3. Under "New", look for your env and select it
